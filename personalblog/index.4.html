This quiet Vietnamese town is home to different ethnic tribal groups. There are five main ethnic groups in Sapa: <b>the Hmong, Dao, Tay, Giay and Xa Pho</b>. It is said that Sapa was first occupied by the first four groups, since the Vietnamese from the lowlands (better known as the Kinh) did not colonise the highest valleys.

These days, Sapa welcomes a diverse range of visitors, attracted by the highland tribes, iconic rice paddies and forest treks. The whole area is blessed with awe-inspiring natural beauty. For more posts <a href='https://vietnamcloseup.blogspot.com/'>click here.</a></p>
