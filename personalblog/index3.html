        <p><h2><b>H'hen Nie</b></h2> is wearing a bà ba suit <em>(a long sleeve, buttoned-down silk shirt),</em> which is a fashion icon of the women in southern Vietnam. <u>The first image of Miss Universe Vietnam</u> clad with a country-side traditional suit surprises many people and receives a lot of appraisals of her fans.

On her personal page, she uploaded her new series of photos which is quite different from previous ones that show her fashion style at showbiz events

The photo is a hit on social media to attract the attention of viewers. Many commented the suit highlights the gracefulness and slenderness of a girl. The "long legs" appears in three rural traditional dresses with her long feminine hair.

H'Hen was born in Đắk Lắk to parents Y'Krin Êban and H'Ngơn Niê and is from the Rade ethnic minority in Vietnam; she was raised speaking the Rade language, and did not learn Vietnamese until she was in eighth grade. H'Hen is the third oldest out of six children, and in her youth, she worked on a coffee farm to assist her family. As per the Rade people's matrilineal customs, Rade women tend to start a family at a young age. However, H'Hen refused to follow this tradition and decided to continue her studies at her own expense.

After graduating from high school, H'Hen studied a year at Nha Trang National Ethnic Community College before moving to Ho Chi Minh City to study corporate finance at the College of Foreign Economic Relations. She worked as a domestic helper for a year to pay the bills while she was in college. When H'Hen was working as an intern at a bank, she began considering a career in modelling.

In 2014, shortly after graduating from college, she was discovered by the Vietnamese designer Đỗ Mạnh Cường while attempting to begin a modelling career. As she gained interest in the industry, she auditioned for season 6 of Vietnam's Next Top Model in 2015, where she became a finalist. She ultimately placed ninth in the competition.
