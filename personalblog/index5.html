Le Tan Loi, a frequent visitor to the annual Vietnamese Traditional Cake Festival, told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper that he comes to the event every year ever since he become a student at the Can Tho University of Economics.
        <p></p>
<q>There are fewer events for people to join in Can Tho than in Ho Chi Minh City, so whenever there is a festival here, I always ask my friends to come with me,</q> Loi said.
        <p></p>
<q>You can try a lot of food here, and also get to know more kinds of dishes that you might have not known before,</q> the Can Tho University of Economics student added.
